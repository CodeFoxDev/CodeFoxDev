Iâ€™m a 15 year old student at Minkema college, the Netherlands. I am
a full stack android and web developer and a UI/UX designer aiming
to build accessible, user-friendly and extremely fast applications.
I have been coding since 2020, I started with scratch, and switched
to Javascript in 2021, wich I'm still using to this day. Along the
way I've tried other languages, like Python, C++, C#, Kotlin & Dart.
